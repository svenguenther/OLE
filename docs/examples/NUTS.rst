Staged NUTS Sampler
=================================================

The notebook ``candl_nuts_example.ipynb`` (located at ``/OLE/examples/candl/``) shows how to run the staged NUTS sampler. In particular, it uses the differentiable CMB likelihood library ``candl`` to build a differentiable pipeline, and explores LCDM constraints from SPT-3G 2018 data.
This tutorial uses some optional packages.
Make sure you have ``candl`` (`arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13433>`_, `github <https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl>`_) and ``getdist`` (`arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13970>`_, `github <https://github.com/cmbant/getdist>`_) installed.
